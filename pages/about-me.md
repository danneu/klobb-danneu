# About Me

<div class="row">
  <div class="ten columns alpha">
I decided to finally claim my own personal nook of the internet. This blog is an effort to give back to the communities in which I've participated, at the very least.

- I'm Dan ([Email](mailto:danrodneu@gmail.com), [Github](https://github.com/danneu))
- I live in Austin, Texas
- Graduated from [Univ of Texas](http://www.utexas.edu/). I also studied at [Univ of Economics, Prague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Economics,_Prague).
- I enjoy Rails, Vim, Autodidacticism, Seneca, and Ricky Gervais' laugh."
